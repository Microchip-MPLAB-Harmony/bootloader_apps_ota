# OTA Bootloader - Dual Bank

This example application shows how to use the OTA Bootloader Library to bootload an application on device having dual bank flash using RNBD.

**OTA Bootloader**

-   This is a OTA bootloader which resides from

    -   The starting location of the flash memory region for SAM devices

    -   The starting location of the Boot flash memory region for PIC32M devices

        -   Uses a Custom linker script **btl.ld** to place it in Boot flash memory


**Performs Below Operation:**

1.  Read the **control block** stored in the last sector of dual bank memory

2.  Checks if **blockUpdated** field is set to 1, then it will update the control block

    -   SAM devices - If **blockUpdated** field is set to 0 then it jumps to **Step 4**

    -   PIC32M devices - If **blockUpdated** field is set to 0 then map Program Flash Bank with higher serial number to the lower region and then it jumps to **Step 4**

3.  Set **blockUpdated** field to 0 and then update the **control block** in the dual bank flash memory. And perform the following operation.

    -   SAM devices - Swap bank and trigger reset

    -   PIC32M devices - Trigger reset

4.  Run OTA application as below

    -   Calls the SYS\_Deinitialize\(\) function which releases the resources used. **This Function is device specific and has to be implemented based on application requirement**

    -   **Jumps to application space to run the OTA application**<br />**OTA Application**


-   This is a OTA application which resides from

    -   The end of bootloader size in device flash memory for SAM devices

    -   The start of Program Flash memory for PIC32M devices

        -   Uses a Custom linker script **app\_mz.ld**/**app\_mk.ld** to place it in Program flash memory

-   It blinks an LED and provides console output

-   It calls the OTA\_SERVICE\_Tasks\(\) function which receives the binary over OTA to be programmed into the inactive flash bank

-   Once the binary is received and programmed into the inactive flash bank, it generates a CRC32 value over programmed inactive flash bank space and verifies it against the received CRC32

-   If verification is successful then it updates the **control block** and trigger reset to run new application binary through OTA bootloader
