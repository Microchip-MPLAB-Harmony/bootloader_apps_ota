## Setting up [PIC32MK MCM Curiosity Pro Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV31E34A)

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:

    -   [RNBD451 Add On Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev25f14a)

-   Short J2-1 and J2-2 using jumper in the [RNBD451 Add On Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev25f14a)

-   Insert [RNBD451 Add On Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev25f14a) board into MIKROBUS Connector J301.

-   Connect the Debug USB port \(J500\) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

-   Connect the USB to UART port \(J400\) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable


**Setting up the host scripts**

-   Refer to [OTA Bootloader Host Script Help](GUID-ECC16920-EE69-48DB-9B32-F774CEB2D079.md) for settings up python scripts which are used in order to update the application binary image


## Running the Application

1.  Open the OTA bootloader project *ota\_bootloader/firmware/pic32mk\_mcm\_curiosity\_pro.X* in the IDE

2.  Make sure that the *ota\_app/firmware/pic32mk\_mcm\_curiosity\_pro.X* is added as a loadable project to OTA bootloader project

    -   As the Dual Bank Flash memory may not have any valid binary **required by OTA bootloader** for the first time, Adding the **ota\_app as loadable** allows MPLAB X to create a **unified hex file** and program both these applications in their respective memory locations based on their linker script configurations

3.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer

4.  Connect to the Serial COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

5.  Build and Program the **OTA bootloader application** using the IDE

6.  Once programming is done OTA bootloader starts execution and directly jumps to application space to **run the OTA application**

    -   **LED1** starts blinking indicating that the **OTA application** is running

    -   Observe the below message on console

    ![console_output1](GUID-CDA76870-3735-4580-A633-0AB445102ED7-low.png)

7.  Go to the **<harmony3\_path\>/bootloader\_apps\_ota/apps/ble/dual\_bank/ota\_app/firmware/pic32mk\_mcm\_curiosity\_pro.X/dist/pic32mk\_mcm\_curiosity\_pro/production/** directory and open the command prompt to run the below command

    ```
     python <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_ota/tools/ota_host_mcu_header.py -p 0x9D080000 -j 0x9D000200 -f pic32mk_mcm_curiosity_pro.X.production.bin
    ```

    -   This command adds OTA Host MCU Header to the application binary. If command executed successful then "image.bin is generated successfully" message display on the command prompt.

8.  Run the below command

    ```
     python <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_ota/tools/ota_rnbd_header.py -f image.bin
    ```

    -   This command adds OTA RNBD Header to the image.bin and generates **RNBD\_image.bin** application binary. If command executed successful then "RNBD\_image.bin is generated successfully" message display on the command prompt.

9.  Refer [Send application binary using MBD App](GUID-B3F7BD29-9883-431D-B682-F405F22C1BE0.md) to program **RNBD\_image.bin** application binary to the target.

10. Once Firmware Update is successful

    -   **LED1** still blinking indicating that the **OTA application** is running

    -   Observe the below message on console

    ![console_output2](GUID-1CD38F31-3F83-4802-AC6D-CF44623B1366-low.png)

11. Repeat Step 9-10.

    -   Observe **LED1** still blinking

    -   Observe message printed on console **\#\#\#\#\#\#\# Application running from Program Flash BANK 1 \#\#\#\#\#\#\#** or **\#\#\#\#\#\#\# Application running from Program Flash BANK 2 \#\#\#\#\#\#\#** alternatively.
