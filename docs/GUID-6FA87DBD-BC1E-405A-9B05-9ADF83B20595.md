## Setting up [SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:

    -   [RNBD451 Add On Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev25f14a)

    -   [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)

-   Short J2-1 and J2-2 using jumper in the [RNBD451 Add On Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev25f14a)

-   Install an [RNBD451 Add On Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev25f14a) on to the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)

-   Connect [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) to the EXT1 header

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable


**Setting up the host scripts**

-   Refer to [OTA Bootloader Host Script Help](GUID-ECC16920-EE69-48DB-9B32-F774CEB2D079.md) for settings up python scripts which are used in order to update the application binary image


## Running the Application

1.  Open the OTA bootloader project *ota\_bootloader/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X* in the IDE

2.  Make sure that the *ota\_app/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X* is added as a loadable project to OTA bootloader project

    -   As the Dual Bank Flash memory may not have any valid binary **required by OTA bootloader** for the first time, Adding the **ota\_app as loadable** allows MPLAB X to create a **unified hex file** and program both these applications in their respective memory locations based on their linker script configurations

    ![mplab_loadable_sam_e54_xpro](GUID-1D907202-A214-4145-8382-9B6E8C3E86E2-low.png)

3.  Build the **OTA bootloader application** using the IDE \(Do not program\)

4.  Go to the **<harmony3\_path\>/bootloader\_apps\_ota/apps/ble/dual\_bank/ota\_bootloader/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X/dist/sam\_e54\_xpro/production/** directory and open the command prompt to run the below command

    ```
     python <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_ota/tools/hex_merge.py -o sam_e54_xpro.X.production.unified.hex -a sam_e54_xpro.X.production_inactive_bank.hex
    ```

    -   sam\_e54\_xpro.X.production\_inactive\_bank.hex is created through post build command in the OTA bootloader project to create additional Bootloader HEX file for the inactive bank. The *hex\_merge* python script is used to combine unified HEX file \(Bootloader and application in active bank\) and bootloader inactive bank HEX file \(Bootloader in inactive bank\). Once command is executed successfully then **sam\_e54\_xpro.X.production.unified.hex** is updated and it contains bootloader inactive bank hex file along with active bank bootloader hex file and active bank application hex file.

5.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer

6.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

7.  Program updated **sam\_e54\_xpro.X.production.unified.hex** using MPLAB X IPE or MPLAB X IDE.

8.  Once programming is done OTA bootloader starts execution and directly jumps to application space to **run the OTA application**

    -   **LED0** starts blinking indicating that the **OTA application** is running

    -   Observe the below message on console

    ![console_output1](GUID-F96B75E3-1E40-4B11-ADD7-675154B63EBF-low.png)

9.  Go to the **<harmony3\_path\>/bootloader\_apps\_ota/apps/ble/dual\_bank/ota\_app/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X/dist/sam\_e54\_xpro/production/** directory and open the command prompt to run the below command

    ```
     python <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_ota/tools/ota_host_mcu_header.py -p 0x82000 -j 0x2000 -f sam_e54_xpro.X.production.bin
    ```

    -   This command adds OTA Host MCU Header to the application binary. If command executed successful then "image.bin is generated successfully" message display on the command prompt.

10. Run the below command

    ```
    python <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_ota/tools/ota_rnbd_header.py -f image.bin
    ```

    -   This command adds OTA RNBD Header to the image.bin and generates **RNBD\_image.bin** application binary. If command executed successful then "RNBD\_image.bin is generated successfully" message display on the command prompt.

11. Refer [Send application binary using MBD App](GUID-B3F7BD29-9883-431D-B682-F405F22C1BE0.md) to program **RNBD\_image.bin** application binary to the target.

12. Once Firmware Update is successful

    -   **LED0** still blinking indicating that the **OTA application** is running

    -   Observe the below message on console

    ![console_output2](GUID-3FCCB88F-0FD2-47A1-9AAD-EC21FEDD8DFD-low.png)

13. Repeat Step 11-12.

    -   Observe **LED0** still blinking

    -   Observe message printed on console **\#\#\#\#\#\#\# Application running from NVM Flash BANK A \#\#\#\#\#\#\#** or **\#\#\#\#\#\#\# Application running from NVM Flash BANK B \#\#\#\#\#\#\#** alternatively.
